# 02112-Project
Project for embedded systems programming

In this project we create a plant monitoring system, with a microcontroller (esp32), to simulate the use of embedded systems.

Components used:
  - button (PTS645)
  - OLED-display (MDOB128064WV-YBI)
  - photocell (Adafruit Industries)
  - piezo buzzer (PS1240)
  - RGB-led (WP154A4SUREQBFZGW)
  - soil sensor (Adafruit Industries)
  - temperature & humidity sensor (AM2320)
